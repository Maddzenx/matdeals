# Next Steps

We've created a unified product system for your grocery deals application. Here's what's been set up:

## What's Been Created

1. **SQL Schema for Unified Products Table**: 
   - Located in `create-products-table.sql`
   - Defines a table to store products from all stores

2. **Shared Utilities for Scrapers**:
   - `supabase/functions/shared/cors.ts` - CORS headers for Supabase Edge Functions
   - `supabase/functions/shared/product-storage.ts` - Utility for storing products in the unified table

3. **Updated Willys Scraper**:
   - `supabase/functions/scrape-willys/index.ts` - Updated to use the unified products table

4. **Migration Script**:
   - `store-unified-products.js` - Migrates products from the Willys Johanneberg table to the unified products table

5. **Frontend Components**:
   - `src/hooks/useUnifiedProducts.tsx` - Hook for accessing products from the unified table
   - `src/components/UnifiedProductList.tsx` - Component for displaying products with filtering

6. **Deployment Script**:
   - `deploy-scrapers.sh` - Script to deploy the scrapers to Supabase

7. **Documentation**:
   - `UNIFIED_STORE_README.md` - Instructions for setting up and using the unified product system

## Next Steps

Here's what you need to do next:

1. **Create the Unified Products Table**:
   ```bash
   # Log in to Supabase Dashboard and run the SQL from create-products-table.sql
   ```

2. **Deploy the Scrapers**:
   ```bash
   ./deploy-scrapers.sh
   ```

3. **Migrate Existing Products**:
   ```bash
   node store-unified-products.js
   ```

4. **Update Your Frontend**:
   - Import and use the `UnifiedProductList` component in your application
   - Or use the `useUnifiedProducts` hook in your own components

## Future Improvements

Consider these improvements for the future:

1. **Add More Stores**:
   - Follow the instructions in `UNIFIED_STORE_README.md` to add more stores

2. **Set Up a Cron Job**:
   - Automatically trigger the scrapers at regular intervals
   - Example: Use GitHub Actions, Supabase scheduled functions, or a server-side cron job

3. **Improve Product Categorization**:
   - Enhance the `determineCategory` function in `useUnifiedProducts.tsx`
   - Consider using machine learning for better categorization

4. **Add User Preferences**:
   - Allow users to save favorite stores and categories
   - Create personalized product recommendations

5. **Implement Price History**:
   - Track price changes over time
   - Show price trends and best times to buy
